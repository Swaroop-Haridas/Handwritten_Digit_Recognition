# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition

This is a Python project for recognizing handwritten digits using the TensorFlow library. The project uses the MNIST dataset, which consists of images of handwritten digits. The purpose of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The project follows these main steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and TensorFlow.
2. Loading the MNIST dataset.
3. Preprocessing the data by normalizing the pixel values and splitting the data into training and testing sets.
4. Building a neural network model using TensorFlow's Keras API.
5. Training the model using the training data.
6. Evaluating the model's performance using the testing data.
